/*Assignment Day 2: 
a) Study primitive and non primitive data types by refering to my recording and can explore it on google too.
b) write a set of code with below sample by adding more types of arithmetic operator like(minus(-),multiply(*),divide(/),remainder(%) and replace it by plus(+) sign in below example.
Example:
let total = 10;
total +=5; //total = total + 5*/


let num1 = 100;
let num2 = 200;
console.log(num1-num2);
console.log(num1+num2);
console.log(num1*num2);
console.log(num1%num2);
console.log(num1/num2);
console.log(num1**num2);
console.log(++num1);
console.log(num1 --);
console.log(num1 --);



console.log()
//primitive data types
let x = 250;
let y = 22.5;
console.log(`Addition of x and y is ${x+y}`);

let a = 100;
let b = 300;
console.log(`Addition of a and b is    ${a+b}`);
console.log(`Subtraction of a and b is ${a-b}`);
console.log(`multiplication of a and b is  ${a*b}`);
console.log(`Divison of a and b is ${a/b}`);
console.log(` equal to a and b is ${a=b}`);


let person =  {
    names :"Anjali",
    age : "30",
    place: "uae" ,
}

console.log(person);
